//Double equals (==) is a comparison operator, which transforms the operands having the same type before comparison
//The equality operator (==) checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. 
// example
var a = 10
var b = 10
console.log(a == b)
// example two
var c = 'hello';
var d = 'hello';
console.log(c == d)
